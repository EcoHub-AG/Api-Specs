      summary: Retrieve all SAF receivers which are available to the caller
      description: This endpoint returns a list of all SAF receivers available to the calling member. A receiver will 
        be included in the list if they are connected to the Standard API Framework (SAF), and if the calling member 
        has an active service agreement with that receiver. The calling member is determined through the techUser
        used for the API request.

      requestBody:
        description: To authenticate the request, the IDP number, password and a one-time activate code for the SAF
          techUser must be provided. These can be retrieved by logging into EcoHub and navigating to the SAF techUsers
          section. Note that SAF techUsers are separate from DXP techUsers. They are not interchangeable, and each has 
          its own set of credentials. Ensure you provide the correct SAF techUser credentials, as this endpoint is 
          specifically designed for SAF techUsers.
